## Projects
### Ensemble Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

Predicting customer satisfaction from text is a core challenge in e-commerce. In this project, I formulated star-rating prediction as a binary classification task, distinguishing 5-star reviews from lower ratings using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I created a custom ensemble ("Blending") model that stacked Logistic Regression, CART, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers, optimizing their weights via OLS regression to achieve a 16% accuracy improvement over the baseline.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
