## Projects
### Ensemble Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

Predicting customer satisfaction from text is a core challenge in e-commerce. In this project, I formulated star-rating prediction as a binary classification task, distinguishing 5-star reviews from lower ratings using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I created a custom ensemble ("Blending") model that stacked Logistic Regression, CART, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers, optimizing their weights via OLS regression to achieve a 16% accuracy improvement over the baseline.

### 7 Million Demand Elasticities: Visualizing the "Retail Apocalypse"

Collaborated with researchers from the San Francisco Fed and UChicago on the "Seven Million Demand Elasticities" (7MDE) project to investigate if broadband proliferation caused a decline in brick-and-mortar retail. Developed an interactive **R Shiny** dashboard to visualize over 7.5 million price elasticity estimates across 14,000 products. The analysis revealed no negative correlation between broadband usage and in-store consumer activity, challenging the retail apocalypse hypothesis.
